replicaCount: 3 # HA setup? Or just 1? StatefulSet usually implies potential for replication but MySQL needs complex replication config. 
# For this exercise, I will assume single primary or stick to 1 replica unless I implement replication sidecars.
# Given the complexity, I'll keep it at 1 for simplicity unless user asked for HA cluster.
# But "StatefulSet" implies we want stable identity.
# Let's just set resources higher for prod.
